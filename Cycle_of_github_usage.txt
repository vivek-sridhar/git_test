Cycle of github usage:
git init - Initialize a repository in your local machine in your project directory
git status - Shows which branch of the project you are on. Initially on Main.
Make changes in the project > Save the changes
git add . - Adds all changes made in the project to the staging area
git commit -m "<message>" - Commits changes in the staging area to the local repository
Create a GitHub repository for your project
git remote add origin
git push origin <branch name> - Pushes the files in the local repository to GitHub.
git clone <Path of GitHub repo> <Optional: name of local repo> - Creates/Updates the latest version of repo in local machine
git branch - Lists all branches available in the local machine {INFO ONLY}
git checkout -b <Branch name> - Creates a new branch with the specified name and switches to it
Make changes in project files > Save changes
git add . - Adds all changes made in the project to the staging area
git commit -m "<message>" - Commits changes in the staging area of the branch to the local repository
git diff <source branch> <target branch>- Highlights differences between branches {INFO ONLY}
git push origin <branch name> - Pushes the files from branch in the local repository to GitHub
